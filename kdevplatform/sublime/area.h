@short Area - the universal view container

Area contains views and toolviews, knows about their positions
and provides functionality to add new (tool)views and remove existing.

Area takes care of all placement/configuration details so that
in order for @ref MainWindow to show the area it just needs to
reconstruct itself according to the area's rules.

Usual way of creating an area is:
@code
Controller *controller = new Controller();
... //document creation code here
Area *area = new Area(controller, "My Area");
area->addView(document->createView());
MainWindow *mw = new MainWindow(controller);
controller->show(area, mw);
@endcode
