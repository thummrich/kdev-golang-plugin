 * something like KDevelop::VcsEvent.
 * This is also a helper class for the LogView::parseOutput() method.
 *
 * @note DVcsEvent is used just to store the data, it doesn't change any of it (for example with QString::trimmed())

 * @see end of CommitViewDelegate::paintGraph() for details of how properties are used
 * @see dvcsEcecutor::parseOutput()
