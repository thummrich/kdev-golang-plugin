/**
 * Wrapper around KShared for use with KSharedPtr when the object is based on QObject as well.
 * Instead of deleting the object once the reference-count reaches zero, QObject::deleteLater() is called.
 * This prevents a possible crash when the reference-count reaches zero during event-processing while the queue
 * contains events to be delivered to that object.
 *
 * Notice however that the object will not be deleted immediately, which may lead to unintended behavior.
