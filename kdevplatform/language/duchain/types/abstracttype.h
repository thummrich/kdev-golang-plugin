/**
 * \brief Base class for all types.
 *
 * The AbstractType class is a base class from which all types derive.  It features:
 * - mechanisms for visiting types
 * - toString() feature
 * - equivalence feature
 * - cloning of types, and
 * - hashing and indexing
 *
 *  Type classes are created in a way that allows storing them in memory or on disk
 *  efficiently.  They are classes which can store arbitrary lists immediately after their
 *  private data structures in memory (thus enabling them to be mmapped or memcopied),
 *  or being "dynamic" where you use exactly the same class and same access functions,
 *  but the list data is stored in a temporary KDevVarLengthArray from a central repository,
 *  until we save it back to the static memory-region again.
 *
 * When creating an own type, you must:
 * - Implement equals(..), hash(). They should _fully_ distinguish all types, in regard to all stored information.
 *  * implement a copy-constructor in which you copy the data from the source using copyData<YourType>()
 *  * Implement clone() in which you use the copy-constructor to clone the type
 * - Add an enumerator "Identity" that contains an arbitrary unique identity value of the type
 * - Add a typedef "BaseType" that specifies the base type, which must be a type that also follows these rules(@todo)
 * - Register the type in a source-file using REGISTER_TYPE(..), @see typeregister.h
 * - Add a typedef "Data", that contains the actual data of the type using the mechanisms described in appendedlist.h.
 *   That data type must follow the same inheritance chain as the type itself, so it must be based on BaseType::Data.
 *   @see AbstractTypeData
 * - When creating a data object in a constructor, use createData<YourType>()
 * - Use TYPE_DECLARE_DATA(YourType) to declare the data access functions, and  then use d_func() and d_func_dynamic() to 
 *   access your type data
 * - Create a constructor that only takes a reference to the type data, and passes it to the parent type
 *
 *   Every type can have only one other type as base-type,
 *   but it can have additional base-classes that are not a direct part of the type-system(@see IdentifiedType).
 *
 *  \sa appendedlist.h
