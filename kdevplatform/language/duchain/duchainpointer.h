 * Whenever the du-chain is unlocked and locked again, any du-chain item may have been deleted in between.
 * For that reason, the following class should be used to make sure that no deleted objects are accessed. It contains a pointer
 * that will be reset to zero once the pointed object is deleted.
 *
 * Access to the data must still be serialized through duchain-locking. Using this comes with no additional cost.
 *
 * In practice this means:
 * Store an instance of DUChainPointer instead of a pointer to the du-chain object.
 * Then, access the eventually still existing object by calling pointer->base().
