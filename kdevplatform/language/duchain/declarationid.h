 * holds a reference to the Declaration instance, whereas the indirect form stores the qualified
 * identifier and an additional index to disambiguate instances of multiple declarations with the same
 * identifier.
 *
 * Both forms also have a specialization index. It can be used in a language-specific way to pick other versions of the declaration.
 * When the declaration is found, Declaration::specialize() is called on the found declaration with this value, and
 * the returned value is the actually found declaration.
