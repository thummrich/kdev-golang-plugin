The way to download, compile, install and run KDevelop depends on how you want
to download it and where do you want to install it to.
So follow the step by step instructions below.

== 1. Get the requirements ==
:Make sure to install the required KDE development packages, see
http://www.kdevelop.org/mediawiki/index.php/KDevelop_4/requirements
for a list of requirements.
In particular make sure to install KDE4 kdelibs development packages:
kdelibs-devel, kdeworkspace-devel (or build from sources).

:'''WARNING:''' You have to remove all KDevelop/KDevplatform/Sublime packages
provided by your distribution. If you don't do that, binary compatibility issues
will eventually lead to crashes and undefined behavior. To make sure, you can
search for KDevelop libraries with this command:

:<pre>find /usr/ -type f -name "*kdev*.so*"</pre>

:If no results are returned, you should be on the safe side.

== 2. Get the sources (assumes ''$HOME/src'' but you can replace it with
something else) ==
* By downloading it to ''$HOME/src''
**  download ''kdevplatform.tar.bz2'' and ''kdevelop.tar.bz2'' from
http://download.kde.org/download.php?url=unstable/kdevelop/
**  unpack them:
        cd $HOME/src
        tar xvjf kdevplatform.tar.bz2
        tar xvjf kdevelop.tar.bz2

* '''Or''', by getting the latest sources directly out of the SVN server
        svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/extragear/sdk/kdevplatform $HOME/src/kdevplatform
        svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/extragear/sdk/kdevelop $HOME/src/kdevelop

== 3. Configure and install KDevPlatform ==

::In both cases you need set the KDEDIRS environment variable to point to the
installation directory of both KDE4 and KDevPlatform.
::This will tell KDE core components where to search for plugins and other data
related to KDE apps and contains just a list of paths (aka prefixes) where KDE
libraries and/or applications have been installed.
::Assuming that you have the KDE4 libraries installed in ''/usr'' (these are
often from packages and installed in ''/usr'' or ''/opt/kde'' and is distro
specific, if unsure ask your distro where it is), you'll have to append it to
the KDEDIRS below.

* To be installed with the system libraries (you '''need root permissions''' to
do this)
        mkdir -p $HOME/src/kdevplatform/build
        cd $HOME/src/kdevplatform/build
        cmake ../
        make
        sudo make install
        export KDEDIRS=/usr/local:/usr
        kbuildsycoca4
* '''Or''', to be installed locally on ''$HOME/kdevelop4'' but you can replace
it with something else (you do '''not need root permissions''' to do this)
        mkdir -p $HOME/src/kdevplatform/build
        cd $HOME/src/kdevplatform/build
        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/kdevelop4 ../
        make
        make install
        export KDEDIRS=$HOME/kdevelop4:/usr
        kbuildsycoca4

== 4. Configure and install KDevelop ==
* To be installed with the system libraries (you '''need root permissions''' to
do this)
        mkdir -p $HOME/src/kdevelop/build
        cd $HOME/src/kdevelop/build
        cmake ../
        make
        sudo make install
        kbuildsycoca4
* '''Or''', to be installed locally on ''$HOME/kdevelop4'' but you can replace
it with something else (you do '''not need root permissions''' to do this)
        mkdir -p $HOME/src/kdevelop/build
        cd $HOME/src/kdevelop/build
        cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/kdevelop4 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/kdevelop4 ../
        make
        make install

::In this case you need set the KDEDIRS environment variable to point to the
installation directory of both KDE4, KDevPlatform and KDevelop.

::This will tell KDE core components where to search for plugins and other data
related to KDE apps and contains just a list of paths (aka prefixes) where KDE
libraries and/or applications have been installed.

::Assuming that you have the KDE4 libraries installed in ''/usr'' (these are
often from packages and installed in ''/usr'' or ''/opt/kde'' and is distro
specific, if unsure ask your distro where it is) and that you want to install
KDevelop4 into ''$HOME/kdevelop4'' then you need to:

        export KDEDIRS=$HOME/kdevelop4:/usr
        kbuildsycoca4

== 5. Get and install plugins (optional) ==

If you need extra functionality, you can get and install additional plugins for
KDevelop4 at [[KDevelop 4/compiling/plugins]].


== 7. Run KDevelop ==
* If installed in the system
        kdevelop
* '''Or''', if installed in ''$HOME/kdevelop4'' local directory
        $HOME/kdevelop4/bin/kdevelop

This assumes you’re running KDevelop4 from a terminal and not via the run dialog
or via a menu entry, if you want that to work you need to find out how to set
environment for the whole X11 session – thats usually distro-specific.

== 8. Contact the development team, or report bugs or wishes ==
:If you find any compile problems with KDevelop4 please don't report them on
bugs.kde.org, please report them on our
[http://www.kdevelop.org/index.html?filename=mailinglist.html developer
mailing-list] instead.

:The [http://bugs.kde.org/ bugzilla bug database] is only for bugs, and
'''not''' for compilation issues.

== 9. Keeping it up-to-date with the latest fixes ==
:If you got the sources from SVN on step 2. then you can update by issuing the
following commands:
* with '''root permissions''' do this
        cd $HOME/src/kdevelop/build && sudo make uninstall
        cd $HOME/src/kdevplatform/build && sudo make uninstall
        svn up .. && make && sudo make install
        kbuildsycoca4
        cd $HOME/src/kdevelop/build
        svn up .. && make && sudo make install
        kbuildsycoca4
* '''Or''' if installed in local directory
        cd $HOME/src/kdevelop/build && make uninstall
        cd $HOME/src/kdevplatform/build && make uninstall
        svn up .. && make && make install
        kbuildsycoca4
        cd $HOME/src/kdevelop/build
        svn up .. && make && make install
        kbuildsycoca4
